What is YouTube marketing?
YouTube marketing is the practice of promoting a brand, product, or service on YouTube. It can involve a mix of tactics, including (but not limited to):
Creating organic promotional videos
Working with influencers
Advertising on the platform
To
market your business on YouTube
— whether you’re an entrepreneur or an enterprise corporation — you need to produce what your target customers want.
Sounds simple, right? It is, as long as you know what your customers really want, not just what you
think
they want (a trap far too many businesses fall into).
Plus, you need to make sure the right people find your videos. YouTube is a search engine so you’ll need to optimize your content for the
YouTube algorithm
, just like you do for Google SEO.
But why is YouTube marketing so important for your business to invest in?
Let’s cover a few major benefits that YouTube can provide.
Reach a major audience.
YouTube is the second-most visited website
in the world
. Its users spend an average of 28 hours per month streaming content on the website. And four in five internet users have used this platform at one time or another. Find even more
important stats in our roundup
that prove just how valuable YouTube can be for business.
Video content sells.
One video marketing survey found that
90% of marketers
have gotten a positive ROI from video. And 88% of marketers have found that video helps their audience better understand their product or service.
Your videos can appear in search results.
Not only do you need to pay attention to
YouTube SEO
, but by considering Google search results, your videos can reach an even wider audience.
Take advantage of YouTube monetization.
Once you’ve built a solid audience, you can make even more money from the ads that appear on your videos.
Now, without further ado, here is your complete, step-by-step checklist for how to successfully promote your business on YouTube.

10-step YouTube marketing strategy
Follow along with these 10 steps to create your business’s YouTube marketing strategy and start promoting your products or services with high-quality video content.
Step 1: Create a YouTube channel for your business
First things first, you have to
create a YouTube channel
.
Since YouTube is part of Google, you’ll need to create a Google account first to sign up for a YouTube channel. You can use an existing account or create one just for managing your business channel.
Here’s how to get up and running:
Create a Google account. Or, if you’re a Google Workspace user, use your admin account or create a YouTube-specific account.
Go to YouTube.com and click the
profile photo
in the top right corner.
Click
Create a channel
at the top of the dropdown menu that appears.
Enter your business name and handle and upload your logo as your profile photo in the popup that appears before clicking
Create channel
. (If you’re not sure if you want to use your business name as your channel name, consider using our
YouTube channel name generator
for some inspiration.)
From there, you’ll be taken to your brand-new YouTube channel!
Click
Customize channel
to start branding it and inputting key information you’ll need to share with your audience if you hope to gain any subscribers.
To fully complete and brand your new YouTube channel, fill out the following details in each tab:
Basic info:
Name
Handle
Pronouns (only if you’re a solopreneur)
Description
Channel URL
External links
Contact information
Branding:
Profile picture
Channel art/banner image
Video watermark
Layout:
Video spotlight
Featured section(s)
Here’s an example of a fully branded YouTube channel so you can get an idea of what to expect once you’re finished:
